# FlaskGuard: Secure Flask Login System Aligned with OWASP Best Practices

**FlaskGuard** is a Python-based web login system built using Flask, demonstrating secure coding practices for authentication and input handling. This project is designed to help learners and junior developers understand how to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and insecure password storage.

## Features

- Secure user authentication with Flask
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt
- Parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection
- Input validation and sanitation
- Session-based access control
- Educational demonstration of secure login flow

---

## Objectives

This project serves as an introduction to secure web development principles by:

- Preventing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Exploring data flow from front-end forms to backend authentication
- Demonstrating secure password handling and verification
- Preparing a base framework for more advanced topics (XSS, brute-force protection, HTTPS)
